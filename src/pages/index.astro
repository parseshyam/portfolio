            <h1>üë®‚Äçüíª Welcome to My Developer Portfolio!</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I am a passionate developer with over 5 years of experience in building robust and scalable web applications. I am eager to build innovative solutions and continuously improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                My expertise includes working with technologies such as Node.js, React, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and queue-based services like RabbitMQ. I also have experience with ElasticSearch and DynamoDB.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few highlights of my work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed and maintained high-performance web applications using Node.js and React.</li>
                <li>Implemented efficient data storage solutions with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redis.</li>
                <li>Designed and managed queue-based services with RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.</li>
                <li>Utilized ElasticSearch for advanced search capabilities and DynamoDB for scalable NoSQL databases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration ideas.
